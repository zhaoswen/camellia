⚠️ Warning: This project is currently in the testing phase. Many component functions are not yet complete, and some components may undergo significant incompatible changes such as name modifications. It is recommended to use this library officially after version 2.0.

## Install

Run this command:

With Flutter:

```shell
flutter pub add camellia
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  camellia: ^1.0.4
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.
